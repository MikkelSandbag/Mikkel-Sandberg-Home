          <h3>Experts Exchange | Website</h3>
          <p class="workDescription">As a front end developer at Experts Exchange, I had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and help create the look and feel of the site. The user profile redesign, the Live product redesign, and the creation of the Headlines feed are a few examples of my work. You can see more details on each below.</p>

          <div class="moreSection">
            <h4>Tools Used</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>HTML/CSS/JS</li>
              <li>Photoshop</li>
              <li>Illustrator</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Profile Page Redesign</h4>
            <a href="img/experts-exchange/ee-profile-page.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><img src="img/experts-exchange/ee-profile-page.jpg" alt="experts exchange profile page"></a>
            <p class="iterationDescription">Shown above is the new profile page that I built with my colleagues. Our goal was to have an initial "business card" view that would display information about the user's areas of expertise and skills. Farther down in the overview section, the user can give information on their background (work history, education, and biography) to serve as a r&eacute;sum&eacute;. There are four other sections that asynchronously load in, which are: the user's recent contributions on the site, certifications earned, ratings from Live or Gigs interactions, and endorsements that the user has given or received. On the right side, one can see the overall "level" of that user, see if the user has a "verified" account, and one can share the profile on social media. The profile owner also has a "preview" button. My role in this project was to create the HTML, CSS, and JS for more advanced user interactions &mdash; beyond what pure HTML and CSS can provide.</p>

            <h4>Live Product Redesign</h4>
            <a href="img/experts-exchange/ee-live-landing-logged-in.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><img src="img/experts-exchange/ee-live-landing-logged-in.jpg" alt="experts exchange live logged in"></a>

            <p class="iterationDescription">The Live product allows clients to connect with consultants in a one-on-one conversation to get help with coding problems. The problem we were facing was that clients didn't know how to get started with the product. Previously, we showed a list of all available consultants and allowed clients to connect with anyone they chose, so the requests were not always a good fit and both sides got frustrated. To solve this problem, we streamlined the whole process by making the help request form front and center for the client. We also gave consultants the ability to specify which topics they were willing to help in. My role in this project was to mock up the initial designs in Photoshop for the help request page that lists the consultants available for a given request, and then to code all of the CSS to pull it off. I also provided new HTML structure when the need arose to work beyond what was already in place.</p>

            <h4>Live Landing Page</h4>
            <a href="img/experts-exchange/ee-live-landing-logged-out.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><img src="img/experts-exchange/ee-live-landing-logged-out.jpg" alt="experts exchange live logged out"></a>
            <p class="iterationDescription">Shown above is the Live product's logged out view. The purpose of this page was to show the viewer why Live is valuable, how it works, and what users like about it &mdash; all in a well-designed and easy to use interface. I took the mockup provided by our UI team and created all the HTML and CSS needed to bring the page to life.</p>

            <h4>Headlines Feed</h4>
            <a href="img/experts-exchange/ee-headlines.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><img src="img/experts-exchange/ee-headlines.jpg" alt="experts exchange headlines feed"></a>
            <p class="iterationDescription">Headlines is intended to be a place for users to see tech news from around the internet. Users have the ability to cater the feed to their needs by hiding specific stories or entire sources, and adding new sources by importing RSS feeds. I created the look and feel of the feed and worked with my team's UI designer to come up with the final "card" design. I also created the HTML and CSS needed to organize the cards at any screen size and adjust to any quantity.</p>

Most of these are personal projects to practice and develop my skills, ranging from fluid simulations to create fire effects, to original character concepts. FireSwing Studios was a start up that I worked at for a couple summers. I created a 3D rendered splash screen for the app that we were working on. Although this splash screen was never implemented, it is still one of my favorite things that I have made.</p>

          <h3>3D Animation</h3>
          <p class="workDescription">You can find my current 3D animation demo reel on <a href="https://vimeo.com/95346384" target="_blank">Vimeo</a>. Most of these are personal projects to practice and develop my skills, ranging from fluid simulations to create fire effects, to original character concepts. FireSwing Studios was a start up that I worked at for a couple summers. I created a 3D rendered splash screen for the app that we were working on. Although this splash screen was never implemented, it is still one of my favorite things that I have made.</p>
